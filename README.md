# CommonJS Tree Shaker plugin for Webpack
[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/webpack-common-shake.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/webpack-common-shake)

Please file an [issue][0] if anything is broken.

See [common-shake][1] for abstract bundler-independent implementation.

_NOTE: [webpack][2] version 4 may be needed in order to run this._
_If you're using webpack 3, please use `webpack-common-shake@1.x`._

_NOTE: Logo is a modified version of [webpack's logo][5]_

## Why?

There are vast amount of CommonJS modules out there. Thus CommonJS Tree Shaking
is as important as the ESM module import/export shaking.

## How?

This plugin removes unused assignments to `exports` properties leaving removal
of the (presumably) dead code to UglifyJS. If, for example, you had a module:

```js
exports.used = 1;
var tmp = exports.unused = 2;
```

This plugin will transform it to:

```js
exports.used = 1;
var tmp = 2;
```

It is up to UglifyJS (or some other optimizer) to decide, whether `tmp` is used
or not and delete it. Luckily it is much simpler for it to do if the uses are
not clouded by exporting the values.

## Usage

Example `webpack.config.js`:
```js
const ShakePlugin = require('webpack-common-shake').Plugin;

module.exports = [{
  entry: 'entry.js'
  output: {
    path: 'dist',
    filename: 'output.js'
  },
  plugins: [ new ShakePlugin() ]
}];
```

## Demonstration

See [webpack-common-shake-demo][4] for size comparison of output with and
without this plugin.

## Options

Plugin constructor accepts `options` object which may have following properties:

```js
const plugin = new ShakePlugin({
  warnings: {
    global: true,
    module: false
  } /* default */,

  // Invoked on every deleted unused property
  onExportDelete: (resource, property) => {},

  // See `Limitations` section for description
  onModuleBailout: (module, bailouts) => { ... },
  onGlobalBailout: (bailouts) => { ... }
});
```

## Limitations

Although, generally this module works and helps removing unused code from the
bundles. There are some limitations that may prevent it from running either
partially or completely. Some examples are provided below, otherwise please use
common sense (or `onModuleBailout`, `onGlobalBailout` plugin options).

Some local (partial) bailouts:

* Dynamic exports `exports[Math.random()] = ...`
* Overriding imported vars `var a = require('./a'); a.lib; a = require('./b')`
* Using `require` in unknown way `console.log(require('./lib'))`
* Destructuring `require` dynamically `{ [prop]: name } = require('./a')`
* Dynamic import `var fn = require('./lib')[Math.random()]`

Some global (full) bailouts:

* Dynamic use of require `require(Math.random())`

This plugin will print some webpack warnings. In any case, bailouts may be
obtained programmatically too:

```js
const plugin = new ShakePlugin({
  onModuleBailout: (module, bailouts) => { ... },
  onGlobalBailout: (bailouts) => { ... }
});
```

## Graph

For debugging and inspection purposes a graph in [dot][3] format may be
obtained using `onGraph` option:

```js
const plugin = new ShakePlugin({
  onGraph: (graph) => { ... }
});
```
